        <h1><b>About the company</b></h1>
        <p>OnePlus Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. is a Chinese consumer electronics manufacturer headquartered in
            Shenzhen, Guangdong, subdistrict of Futian District.
        </p>
        <p> It was founded by Pete Lau and Carl Pei in December 2013, and is currently majority-owned by Oppo as its
            only shareholder,
            which is a subsidiary of BBK Electronics along with Vivo, Realme and iQOO.
            The company is best known for making smartphones, and officially serves 34 countries
            and regions around the world as of July 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            OnePlus was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei. According to
            Chinese public records, OnePlus' only institutional shareholder is Oppo Electronics. Lau denied that
            OnePlus was a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the
            phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus and that they are "in talks with other investors",
            although OnePlus has confirmed it uses Oppo's manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain
            resources with Oppo.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The company's main goal was to design a smartphone that would balance high-end
            quality with a lower price than other phones in its class, believing that users would "Never Settle" for the
            lower-quality devices produced by other companies. Lau explained that "We will never be different just for
            the sake of being different. Everything done has to improve the actual user experience in daily use."
        </p>
        <p>
            He also showed aspirations of being the "Muji of the tech industry", emphasizing its focus on
            high-quality products with simplistic, user-friendly designs. Continuing Lau's association with the
            platform from the Oppo N1, OnePlus entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Cyanogen Inc. to
            base its products' Android distribution upon a variant of the popular custom ROM CyanogenMod and use its
            trademarks outside China.
